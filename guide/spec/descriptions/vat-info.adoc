= VAT

VAT information on line level is provided in the class `cac:ClassifiedTaxCategory` in both the pre-award catalogue request and the pre-award catalogue.

VAT information is optional in both transactions, but if the contracting authority has sent VAT info in the pre-award catalogue request, the economic operator should provide this information in the corresponding pre-award catalogue.
