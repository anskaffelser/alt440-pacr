= Requested Item Properties

Requested item properties, like a specific colour of an item, can be sent in the element `cac:AdditionalItemProperty`. This element can contain information on requested property name, quantity, range, classification and request relevance, i.e if the property request is mandatory, optional, forbidden or for information. If the relevance code is set to mandatory, information on that property shall be included in the corresponding pre-award catalogue, using the identifier as sent in the request, if code is forbidden this cannot be a property of the item, and hence its value shall not be sent in the catalogue.
