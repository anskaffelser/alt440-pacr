The Pre-award catalogue request is a tool for Contracting authorities (CA) to describe requirements and required characteristics for respectively of goods, services and works in a structured manner. A Pre-award catalogue request contains a generic description of the CA's needs. Based on the generic descriptions and requirements the economic operator (EO) creates a Pre-award catalogue based on their own assortment of goods, services or works to fulfil the requirements of the CA. Means of proof can be included and the evidence must be provided by EO in the pre-award catalogue.

Means for providing generic descriptions of requirements can be classifications systems such as UNSPSC, CPV or eCl@ss. These classification systems provide codes that codify classes of goods, services or works in a vendor-neutral manner. Furthermore, some of these classification systems codify properties of goods, services or works by providing property codes, for instances, codes for length, width or height of a goods.

But also required skills or non-functional requirements may specified in a Pre-award catalogue requests, for instance, to specify that environmental aspects shall be considered by the offered goods, services, or works, or to specify that certain professional skills, for instance, to able to work as a nurse, are required. To prove that these requirements or skills are fulfilled respectively are available labels or information on other means of proof can then be provided in the Pre-award catalogue by the EO.

Summarized, using electronic catalogues in the tendering procedures will save processing time both for EO's and CA's and will enhance transparency and traceability of goods, services and works. To achieve efficient and effective processes, the EO should have their own e-submission systems based on a 4-corner model to be able to communicate with different tendering platforms based on standard formats and PEPPOL eDelivery network.
